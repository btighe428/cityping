# CityPing Tone & Personality Guide

## The Voice

CityPing is your **parking buddy** — a friend who's got your back on NYC streets. Not a corporate notification system. Not a robotic alert. A companion who actually cares whether you get a ticket.

---

## Personality Traits

### 1. **Reliably Chill**
We deliver important information without being dramatic or alarmist. Parking stress is real — we reduce it, not add to it.

- ✅ "Good news! ASP is suspended tomorrow."
- ❌ "URGENT: IMPORTANT PARKING ALERT!!!"

### 2. **Genuinely Helpful**
Every message has a purpose. We don't spam. When we reach out, it's because we have something useful to say.

- ✅ "No need to move your car tonight. Sleep in."
- ❌ "Just checking in! How's your parking going?"

### 3. **Slightly Playful**
A touch of personality without being obnoxious. We're not a comedy newsletter — but we're not boring either.

- ✅ "5 suspensions this week. Your car's basically on vacation."
- ❌ "OMG FIVE DAYS!!! 🎉🎉🎉 PARTY TIME!!!"

### 4. **NYC Native**
We know the streets. We get the struggle. We speak like a New Yorker — direct, efficient, no BS.

- ✅ "Holy Thursday through Easter — 4 days, don't move it."
- ❌ "Please be advised that alternate side parking regulations will be suspended for a period of four consecutive days."

## Copy Principles

### ✅ DO:
- **Lead with the benefit** ("No need to move" > "ASP suspended")
- **Use contractions** (you'll, won't, don't, it's)
- **Be specific** (dates, days of week, holiday names)
- **Vary the copy** (don't say the same thing every email)
- **Respect their time** (scannable, not walls of text)

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use corporate speak ("Please be advised", "per our records")
- Over-explain ASP rules (they know)
- Add unnecessary urgency (all caps, exclamation abuse)
- Be too casual/jokey (we're useful, not a meme account)
- Pad messages with filler

| **Summer (lighter months)** | "Quiet summer month. Just [X] to note." |
| **Fall holidays** | "Peak season for suspensions. [X] coming up." |

### Holiday-Specific Personality

## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Over-enthusiastic
```
WOW!!! 🎉🎉🎉 AMAZING NEWS!!! You don't have to move your car!!!
ISN'T THAT INCREDIBLE?!?! 🚗💨✨
```

### ❌ Corporate robot
```
Dear Valued Subscriber,

This email is to inform you that Alternate Side Parking regulations
will be suspended on the date specified below pursuant to NYC DOT
guidelines. Please reference the following information...
```

### ❌ Padding with filler
```
Hey there! Hope you're having a great week! Just wanted to drop
you a quick note to let you know that tomorrow is going to be
a special day because — you guessed it — ASP is suspended!
How cool is that? Anyway, here's the details...
```

```
🎉 Good news!
ASP is suspended tomorrow.

Tomorrow: Thursday, December 25, 2025
Reason: Christmas Day

No need to move your car tonight. Sleep in! 😴
```

## Implementation Notes

### Variation System
To keep emails fresh, rotate copy for repeated elements:

**"No need to move" alternatives:**
- "No need to move your car tonight."
- "Your car can stay put."
- "Leave it where it is."
- "Skip the shuffle tonight."

**"Sleep in" alternatives:**
- "Sleep in! 😴"
- "Enjoy the extra rest."
- "One less thing to worry about."
- (Sometimes: just end after the info — variety)

### Future: Personalization
Eventually, let users choose tone:
- **Standard** (default) — Friendly, helpful
- **Just the facts** — Minimal, data only
- **Extra friendly** — More personality, casual
