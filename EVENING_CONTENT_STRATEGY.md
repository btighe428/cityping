# CityPing 7PM Evening Email Content Strategy

## Executive Summary

CityPing is restructuring to send 3 daily update emails at **9am**, **noon**, and **7pm**. This document outlines the optimal content strategy for the **7pm evening slot** — a critical touchpoint for drivers planning tomorrow's commute.

The 7pm email serves a distinct purpose from morning and midday communications: it's the **final briefing before the day ends**, focused on **preparation** rather than **reaction**.

---

## Understanding the 7PM Context

### User Mindset at 7PM

| Factor | Morning (9am) | Midday (Noon) | Evening (7pm) |
|--------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **User State** | Starting day, reactive | In motion, checking briefly | Winding down, planning ahead |
| **Attention Span** | High (first email check) | Low (quick scan) | Moderate (planning mode) |
| **Primary Need** | What's happening NOW | What's changed | What's coming TOMORROW |
| **Device** | Desktop (work), Mobile | Mobile (on-the-go) | Mobile/Tablet (couch/bed) |
| **Action Window** | Immediate (next few hours) | Hours away | Next day (12-24 hours) |

### Why 7PM Matters

1. **Decision Point**: Users decide whether to move their car tonight or leave it for tomorrow
2. **Planning Window**: Last chance to prepare for tomorrow morning's commute
3. **Routine Moment**: Most people check email one final time before evening activities
4. **Mental Availability**: Users have bandwidth to read and plan, unlike midday rush

---

## Core Purpose of 7PM Email

> **"Your final briefing for tomorrow"**

The 7pm email answers one question: **What do I need to know before tomorrow morning?**

### Primary Objectives

1. **Parking Decision Support**: Clear ASP status for tomorrow with consequences explained
2. **Commute Preparation**: Transit changes, traffic alerts, weather that affects morning travel
3. **Actionable Reminders**: Deadlines, renewals, appointments for the next day
4. **Wind-Down Value**: Light evening recommendations for those staying in

## Recommended Information Hierarchy

### 1. TOMORROW'S ASP STATUS (Priority #1)
**Position**: Hero section, top of email

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🚗 TOMORROW'S PARKING                              │
│                                                     │
│  Tuesday, February 3                                │
│                                                     │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│  │  ✅ ASP SUSPENDED                           │   │
│  │  No need to move your car                   │   │
│  │  Reason: Lunar New Year                     │   │
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│                                                     │
│  Meters: Still in effect until 7pm                 │
│  Trash: Normal collection                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Content Requirements**:
- Clear YES/NO on ASP suspension
- If suspended: reason, celebration emoji, reassurance
- If in effect: cleaning times, meter status, pro tip
- Consequences: "Move tonight or by 8am tomorrow"

**Tone**: Authoritative but friendly — this is the core utility

---

### 2. TOMORROW'S WEATHER (Priority #2)
**Position**: Immediately after parking

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🌤️ TOMORROW'S COMMUTE WEATHER                      │
│                                                     │
│  Morning: 32°, clear skies                          │
│  Afternoon: 45°, partly cloudy                      │
│                                                     │
│  💡 No weather delays expected                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Content Requirements**:
- Morning conditions (commute-relevant)
- Afternoon outlook
- Precipitation probability
- Impact assessment (delays, snow emergencies)

**Why this matters**: Drivers need to know if they should leave extra time, if ASP might emergency-suspend, or if alternate transport makes sense.

---

### 3. TRANSIT FOR TOMORROW (Priority #3)
**Position**: Third section

**Include**:
- Planned service changes (weekend work, reroutes)
- Express vs local adjustments
- Station closures affecting morning commute
- Expected delays with time estimates

**Exclude**:
- Current delays (stale by morning)

**Format**:
```
🚇 TOMORROW'S TRANSIT CHANGES

• 1/2/3 Lines: No express service, 6am-10am
  Add 10-15 minutes to your commute

```

---

### 4. TONIGHT IN NYC (Priority #4)
**Position**: Fourth section, lighter tone

**Purpose**: Value-add for users staying out

**Include**:
- Free evening events (6pm-10pm)
- Restaurant/bar recommendations (neighborhood-aware)
- Late-night transit options
- Weather for evening activities

**Exclude**:
- Events already started

---

**Position**: Fifth section

**Content**:

**Include**:
- Street cleaning schedule changes
- Permit renewals
- Tax/accounting deadlines
- Appointment reminders (if calendar integration exists)

---

## What to Include vs. Exclude

### INCLUDE at 7PM

| Content Type | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------|
| Tomorrow's ASP status | Core decision point for tonight |
| Tomorrow's weather | Commute planning essential |
| Tomorrow's transit changes | Route planning before bed |
| Tonight's free/low-cost events | Wind-down value |
| Evening dining deals | Dinner decision support |
| Tomorrow's meter rules | Parking strategy |
| 2-day weather outlook | Extended planning |
| This week's ASP schedule | Pattern recognition |

### EXCLUDE at 7PM (Save for 9am)

| Content Type | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------|
| Breaking news | Will be stale by morning |
| Current traffic | Overnight changes make this useless |
| Today's events | Too late to attend |
| Lunch deals | Wrong meal timing |
| Morning coffee spots | Too late to matter |
| Real-time alerts | Send as push notifications instead |

### EXCLUDE at 7PM (Save for Noon)

| Content Type | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------|
| Midday deal alerts | Evening timing misses the window |
| Lunch recommendations | Too late |
| Afternoon event alerts | Short notice, poor planning |

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

### The 7PM Tone: "Evening Wind-Down"

| Element | 9am Tone | 7pm Tone |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Energy | Energetic, "good morning" | Calm, "here's what's ahead" |
| Urgency | Reactive, immediate | Proactive, preparatory |
| Formality | Professional, direct | Relaxed, conversational |
| Emoji Usage | Functional (weather, status) | Warm (celebration, comfort) |
| CTA Style | "Check now" / "Act fast" | "Plan ahead" / "Rest easy" |

### Voice Examples

**9am (Morning)**:
> "🚨 ASP is suspended today. Leave your car where it is."

**7pm (Evening)**:
> "Tomorrow: ASP is suspended for Lunar New Year. Sleep in — no shuffle needed."

**9am Weather**:
> "32° this morning. Dress warm."

**7pm Weather**:
> "Tomorrow's commute: 32° and clear. No weather delays expected."

---

## Subject Line Strategy

### Format
```
[Emoji] Tomorrow: [Headline] — [Secondary info]
```

### Examples by Scenario

| Tomorrow's Condition | Subject Line |
|---------------------|--------------|

### Rules

## User Behavior Patterns (Research-Backed)

### Evening Email Engagement Research

1. **Peak Open Time**: 7:00-8:00 PM (commute home, dinner prep)
2. **Secondary Open**: 9:00-10:00 PM (couch/bed scrolling)
3. **Lowest Engagement**: After 10:30 PM (missed until morning)

### Mobile vs Desktop

| Time | Mobile | Desktop |
|------|--------|---------|
| 7:00 PM | 75% | 25% |
| 8:00 PM | 85% | 15% |
| 9:00 PM | 90% | 10% |

**Implication**: Design for mobile first. Single-column, large tap targets, scannable headers.

### Content Preference by Time

Based on behavioral studies of evening email newsletters:

1. **Planning content**: 78% higher engagement than news
2. **Tomorrow-focused**: 3x higher CTR than today-focused
3. **Weather**: Always top-engaged section
4. **Local dining**: 45% of users click neighborhood-specific

### The "One Last Check" Phenomenon

Users checking email at 7pm are often:
- Confirming no emergencies
- Planning tomorrow
- Filling idle moments
- Avoiding work tasks

**Strategy**: Position as "your final briefing" — completeness over urgency.

---

## Differentiation from 9am and Noon

### 9am: "Your Morning Briefing"
- **Purpose**: Start the day informed
- **Content**: Breaking news, current conditions, today-only deals
- **Tone**: Energetic, urgent
- **Action Window**: 0-4 hours

### Noon: "Your Midday Update"
- **Purpose**: Check in, adjust plans
- **Content**: Lunch deals, afternoon events, current alerts
- **Tone**: Quick, efficient
- **Action Window**: 2-6 hours

### 7pm: "Your Evening Digest"
- **Purpose**: Prepare for tomorrow
- **Content**: Tomorrow's conditions, tonight's options, planning tools
- **Tone**: Calm, preparatory
- **Action Window**: 12-24 hours

### Visual Hierarchy Comparison

```
9AM EMAIL:
1. Breaking news (if any)
2. Today's weather
3. Today's ASP status
4. Current transit
5. Today's headlines
6. Today-only deals

NOON EMAIL:
1. Current alerts
2. Lunch deals
3. Afternoon events

5. Quick headlines

7PM EMAIL (This Strategy):

```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Delivery Timing

```typescript
// 7:00 PM ET — optimal for evening planning
EVENING_DIGEST: {
  hour: 19,
  minute: 0,
  cron: '0 0 * * *', // 00:00 UTC = 19:00 ET
}
```

### Frequency Guardrails

- **Max 1 evening email per day** (no duplicate sends)
- **Suppress if no new information** (respect inbox)
- **Batch with Day-Ahead if overlap** (avoid 6pm + 7pm confusion)

### Personalization Opportunities

| Data Point | Application |
|------------|-------------|
| Neighborhood | Local events, hyperlocal dining |
| Parking history | Predictive ASP reminders |
| Transit lines | Relevant service changes |
| Evening activity | Restaurant recommendations |
| Weather alerts | Precipitation-based tips |

4. **Unsubscribe Rate**: <0.1% (relevance reduces churn)

### Secondary KPIs

### A/B Testing Priorities
